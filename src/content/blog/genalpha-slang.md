### Overview
The president of Koshland, has officially banned the use of Gen Alpha slang. This decision stems from the president's belief that such slang is not only pointless but also contributes to a decline in meaningful communication among the youth. 

### Reasons for the Ban

1. **Pointless and Confusing Language**  
   The president has expressed frustration with the new slang emerging from Gen Alpha, stating, 

> "The slang these kids are saying is actually unbelievable. Like what the heck is 'fanum tax' supposed to mean?"

This sentiment reflects a broader concern that the constant evolution of slang creates barriers to clear communication, leaving older generations bewildered and disconnected.

2. **Cultural Impact**  
   As slang continues to evolve rapidly, it risks alienating those who do not keep up with the latest trends. This shift can hinder intergenerational conversations and understanding, as each generation develops its own lexicon. The president's ban is a call to encourage more meaningful and straightforward communication among all age groups.

3. **Preserving Language Integrity**  
   By banning Gen Alpha slang, Koshland aims to preserve the integrity of the language and promote clarity in communication. The concern is that excessive slang can lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings, ultimately degrading the quality of discourse in society.

4. **Actual parents are starting to use the slang now**

The slang, being originally said by children, has now reached their parents.
